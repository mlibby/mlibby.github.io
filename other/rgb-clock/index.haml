      %h2 The RGB Clock
      %p
        This is a Javascript prototype of an <a href="https://github.com/mlibby/arduino/tree/master/RgbClock">RGB Clock</a>
        I made with Arduino, RGB LEDs, and a couple of shift registers.
      %p
        "Normal" clocks display time in base 10 (that is, digits 1234567890). Nerds often make clocks in binary (base 2
        \-- just 0s and 1s, or lights that are on or off). This clock uses Red, Green, and Blue instead of numerals
        (denoting the values of zero, one, and two)
      %p
        This clock includes the place numbers for the base 3 numbers to help decode/understand the numbers of the
        clock.
        It also includes a "normal" 24 hour clock to aid in double-checking the LED display. The real clock will simply
        be 11 LED bulbs.
