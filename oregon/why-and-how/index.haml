  %h2 The Story Behind My Remake of Oregon Trail
  %p
    Many people grew up with the computer game &quot;
    %a{ href: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(series)" } 
      The Oregon Trail
    &quot; by

      MECC
    \. If you are feeling nostalgic you can buy a
    %a{ href: "https://smile.amazon.com/The-Oregon-Trail-Handheld-Game/dp/B07B61BFSW/" }
      handheld gadget
    in stores that has an early version of the game on it (often incorrectly referred to as the
    &quot;original&quot; version) or you can download an
    %a{ href: "https://www.thefreecountry.com/emulators/apple-2.shtml" }
      Apple II emulator
    and a
    %a{ href: "https://archive.org/details/Oregon_Trail_Disk_1_of_2" } 
      virtual disk of the game
    \.

    BUT that isn&apos;t the
    %em original
    version of the game! My first computer was actually in a
    room across town from school and we used a teletype to connect to it (
    %a{ href: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33" } 
      read more
    ). There was no screen, it was just a typewriter with a really long roll of paper.
    The computer printed some stuff out, you typed some stuff in,
    back and forth... just letters and numbers on paper. It was on a system like that when I first fell in love
    with the game &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;.
  %p
    So for years and years now, I&apos;ve wanted to relive that first early computing experience and have never found a
    way to. But lucky for me, some people have managed to preserve and share
    %a{ href: "http://web.archive.org/web/20180706191111/https://www.filfre.net/tag/the-oregon-trail/" }
      the original BASIC source code
    to the game. Now most of us don&apos;t have access to a system that would run this
    code. And I&apos;m not sure if there&apos;s even an emulator for these old machines that is easy to find and use. But
    with the source code, I figured I&apos;d be able to recreate the
    game in all its original glory in some newer programming language. So I did.
  %p
    What I&apos;ve done here is translate the original code into Javascript, so it can run directly in a web browser --
    that way pretty much any device around these days would be able to play the game. If you look at
    %a{ href: "https://github.com/mlibby/mlibby.github.io/blob/master/js/src/oregon.js" }
      my source code
    for the game, you&apos;ll see that I&apos;ve done a very literal translation for the most part. It
    looks horrible, but doing it the way I did allowed me to audit my code right alongside the original to make
    sure I was getting everything exactly the same.
    My goal here was to recreate the game, faithfully, not to write brilliant code, after all.
