<div class="row"><div class="col"><section id="oregon-trail"><h2>The Story Behind My Remake of Oregon Trail</h2><p>Many people grew up with the computer game &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(series)">The Oregon Trail</a>&quot; by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECC">MECC</a>. If you are feeling nostalgic you can buy a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/The-Oregon-Trail-Handheld-Game/dp/B07B61BFSW/">handheld gadget</a>in stores that has an early version of the game on it (often incorrectly referred to as the
 &quot;original&quot; version) or you can download an <a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/emulators/apple-2.shtml">Apple II emulator</a> and a <a href="https://archive.org/details/Oregon_Trail_Disk_1_of_2">virtual disk of the game</a>.</p><p>BUT that isn&apos;t the <em>original</em> version of the game! My first computer was actually in a
room across town from school and we used a teletype to connect to it (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">read more</a>). There was no screen, it was just a typewriter with a really long roll of paper. 
The computer printed some stuff out, you typed some stuff in,
back and forth... just letters and numbers on paper. It was on a system like that when I first fell in love
with the game &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;.</p><p>So for years and years now, I&apos;ve wanted to relive that first early computing experience and have never found a
way to. But lucky for me, some people have managed to preserve and share <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20180706191111/https://www.filfre.net/tag/the-oregon-trail/">the original BASIC source code</a> to the game. Now most of us don&apos;t have access to a system that would run this
code. And I&apos;m not sure if there&apos;s even an emulator for these old machines that is easy to find and use. But
 with the source code, I figured I&apos;d be able to recreate the
  game in all its original glory in some newer programming language. So I did.</p><p>What I&apos;ve done here is translate the original code into Javascript, so it can run directly in a web browser --
that way pretty much any device around these days would be able to play the game. If you look at <a href="https://github.com/mlibby/mlibby.github.io/blob/master/js/app/oregon.js">my source code</a> for the game, you&apos;ll see that I&apos;ve done a very literal translation for the most part. It
 looks horrible, but doing it the way I did allowed me to audit my code right alongside the original to make
  sure I was getting everything exactly the same.
   My goal here was to recreate the game, faithfully, not to write brilliant code, after all.</p><button class="play-oregon btn btn-primary mb-3">Play The Oregon Trail</button></section></div></div>
