    The quote above from the game Oregon Trail is an internet meme
    at this point... but did you know it wasn&apos;t in the original game? The first version of Oregon Trail
    was a text-only adventure written for a timeshare computer that students would interact with at a teletype
    terminal. It was this version that I first encountered. I have been wanting to see it again for some time now.
  %p
    This is my attempt to re-create that original version of &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;.
    There are no graphics. Whenever the computer has printed out its part, you will get an
    input box for your response. Just type into it and press Enter/Return. If the program is
    expecting a number, you will only be able to type numbers into the box.
  %p
    Please enjoy! If you are interested, here is <a href='/oregon/why-and-how'> an essay with more background on why and how</a>
    I put this together.
