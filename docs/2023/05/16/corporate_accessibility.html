		<h1>Corporate Responsibility: Blazor and Accessibility Edition</h1>
		<div class="date">Published: 2023-05-16</div>
		<p>
It sure would be nice if large corporations like Microsoft would produce documentation about their web framework Blazor that included 100% accessible examples and had nice big sections like "how to use this stuff accessibly". Instead they've announced the layoffs of over 10,000 employees this year so far.
</p>
<p>
To Microsoft's credit, just yesterday I submitted a suggestion for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/forms-and-input-components?view=aspnetcore-8.0">their documentation related to radio buttons</a> and they responded <strong>immediately</strong> and changed it. However, they did not change the examples I didn't suggest fixes for, so some of the examples are still inaccessible.
</p>
<p>
Actually, my guess is that <strong>all</strong> of the examples are inaccessible, including the one I suggested a fix for. Because Blazor itself is not accessible by default. I'm not an expert, but as far as I can tell the only thing their native form components do when a form field is invalid is mark the input element with <code>aria-invalid="true"</code>. When I tested my code that followed their examples using NVDA on an invalid form, the screenreader said <strong>nothing</strong>. It was like I didn't even try to submit the form. Seems like if the <code>&lt;ValidationSummary&gt;</code> component isn't going to follow <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/notifications/">the validation feedback practices recommended by W3C's WAI</a>, then the docs should cover how to ensure the feedback is accessible.
</p>
<p>
It would be nice if a random web developer like me could count on <code>&lt;ValidationSummary&gt;</code> to automagically be accessible by default, perhaps by putting a <code>role="alert"</code> on the <code>&lt;ul class="validation-errors"&gt;</code> element that gets created from it. But in reading the guidance from WAI it's clear there is a one-size-fits-all solution. So fine. But at least have an example in the document that discusses calling the component as <code>&lt;ValidationSummary role="alert" aria-label="form validation errors"&gt;</code> to address the fact that this information won't otherwise be announced to screenreader users (note, the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.forms.validationsummary?view=aspnetcore-8.0">document for <code>ValidationSummary</code></a> doesn't mention any of this either).
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's shareholders can certainly afford to pay for some accessibility specialists who will certainly do a better job than I ever could at crafting documentation and examples (if not consulting on the framework itself) and while I was happy to submit one fix, I'm not volunteering to do all the fixes, especially since I am not an expert in this area. As it is, anyone out there using Blazor to make web sites (like I am), relying on Microsoft's documentation for how to do things, is walking into a minefield of potential ADA violations. For my part, I think Microsoft should be held accountable for each and every one of those violations as if they'd done it themselves. This is a company with a market capitalization of $2.32 trillion (with a T), annual revenues in the hundreds of billions (with a B), and that buys back billions of dollars of stock each year.
</p>
<p>
Final note: nothing I'm saying here is meant to disparage the <strong>employees</strong> on the Blazor team, especially those working specifically on accessibility (please let there be at least one!). I'm sure they are all overworked and underpaid, especially relative to multi-hundred-millionaire CEO Satya Nadella.
