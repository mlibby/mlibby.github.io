  %h2 Summary
  %p I have over a decade of professional experience as a web and applications developer on projects of all sizes using a variety of programming languages and frameworks. Working directly with users and stakeholders, I have consistently built software that exceeded expectations.
  %p Project highlights include: building web sales reports without access to a web server, designing and developing complex data migration systems, building user-friendly, efficient UIs, and improving performance and reliability of data analysis applications.
  %p Over the years, I have written applications in Perl, Ruby (with and without Rails), VBA (mostly in Access), SQL Server T-SQL, VB.NET, C#, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, BackboneJS-- just to name a few. Third party tools I have worked with include Oracle, MySQL, Kofax Capture and Transformation, Excel. In addition to being a Windows developer, I speak fluent Linux.
