  I've finally gotten around to putting this site on Jekyll. Well, almost.
%p
  It's a work in progress. I am dumping the Bootstrap framework for styling and layout, so 
  I do need to update some styles and layouts around the site. And not all of the old pages
  have been converted yet.

%p
  This is a sample code snippet I'm trying to style:
  :coderay
    #!ruby
    def foo
      puts "bar"
    end
