          h2 AI: About the 8 or 15 Puzzle
          p
            | The 8 Puzzle consists of a 3x3 board with eight numbered tiles and an empty spot. A tile adjacent to the empty
            | spot can slide into that spot. The goal of the puzzle is to order all of the tiles numerically, leaving the
            | empty spot in the lower-right corner. The 15 Puzzle is the same puzzle only with 15 tiles on a 4x4 board.

                | One thing we might want to know is just how many possible starting positions there are
                | for the puzzle. That is, we can scramble the tiles around randomly and there would be 
                | 9x8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1 possible permutations, but many (most?) of these will not result in
                | puzzles that can be solved. In a physical implementation of this game, the tiles must
                | slid around one by one to scramble the puzzle. If we scramble the digital version of 
                | this puzzle the same way, we guarantee that we can solve each starting position because
                | we know that the solution is just the reverse of the steps used to scramble the puzzle
                | in the first place.
