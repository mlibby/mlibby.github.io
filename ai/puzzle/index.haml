  %h2 AI: Solve the 8 Puzzle
  %p
    The 8 Puzzle consists of a 3x3 board with eight numbered tiles and an empty spot. A tile adjacent to the empty
    spot can slide into that spot. The goal of the puzzle is to order all of the tiles numerically, leaving the
    empty spot in the lower-right corner.
