          h2 AI: Solving the 15 Puzzle
          p
            | The 15 Puzzle is a slightly larger version of the #[a(href="/ai/puzzle") 8 Puzzle] that
            | consists of a 4x4 board with fifteen numbered tiles and an empty spot. A tile adjacent to the empty
            | spot can slide into that spot. The goal of the puzzle is to order all of the tiles numerically, leaving the
            | empty spot in the lower-right corner.
